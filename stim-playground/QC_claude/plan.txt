1. add the damp channel same as the one in stsim

2. make sure the pauliT version fit to that version


3. simulate the exact with QC_claude and the one with PauliT with stim(sinter)
    -- analyze the sampling cost 

4. analyze the LER of those two versions

5. adapt to BB code and BP-OSD decoder (as well as relayBP)


6. see if the detector error model from duke is better
